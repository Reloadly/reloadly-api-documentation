  - name: Authentication
    description: Reloadly uses access tokens ( or bearer tokens ) to authenticate requests and grant access to our APIs. Access tokens differ across our various products. This means that you can only use an access token generated for the airtime service on the Airtime API, the same goes for other products. <br><br> Also, Reloadly has two operating environments - **Production** which allows you work with live credentials while building real world applications and **Sandbox** which helps you access our APIs in test mode and simulate real-like scenarios. Below is a table that shows the server URL for Reloadly's Airtime products. <br><br> <table><thead><tr><th>Product</th><th>Environment</th><th>Service URL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Airtime</td><td>Production</td><td>https://topups.reloadly.com</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sandbox</td><td>https://topups-sandbox.reloadly.com</td></tr><tr><td>Number Lookup</td><td>Production</td><td>https://topups.reloadly.com</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sandbox</td><td>https://topups-sandbox.reloadly.com</td></tr></tbody></table> <br><br> To get an access token, first obtain your **client id** and **client secret** from the <a href="https://www.reloadly.com/">Reloadly dashboard</a>. Then make a **POST** request with the payload format provided in the code sample section.

The operator's FX rate is calculated against the currency of the airtime sender's account. 
    
  - name: FX Rates
    description: Airtime **FX Rates** provide details on the exchange rate of an operator at which an airtime recharge will be made. This is helpful for the following use cases <br> <ul><li>Cross-border digital payments</li><li>Airtime remittances</li><li>International top-ups</li></ul> <br> Important data included in the details for **FX Rates** are the operator's ID, name, current exchange rate ( this is pegged against your account's currency ), and currency code. 
  - name: Commissions
    description: The data on **Commissions** provides you with details of operators that offer a percentage discount for every airtime recharge.

  - name: Promotions

  - name: Top-ups
    description: The **Top-ups** feature works with other features in the Airtime product to make recharges to a mobile number. Actions you can carry out include making an instant airtime recharge to both local and international mobile numbers as well as making an asynchronous recharge that enables you to monitor and receive notifications about its status. <br> Some of the information you can view includes the transaction ID, the custom identifier for each top-up, the discount applied to each top-up, and the amount sent via the top-up.

Important data in the details of every airtime transaction include the transaction ID, transaction date, operator's name, recipient's mobile number, sender's mobile number, and the discount applied to the transaction  —  if there was any. 
  
  - name: Number Lookup
    description: Reloadly offers a mobile number portability lookup service that enables you to retrieve the network operator details of a mobile number. <br> <br> There is a rising trend where mobile numbers are ported to a different network operator.

The user may make an HTTP **GET** or **POST** request to retrieve the details of the mobile number. <br> <br> <blockquote  style="padding:15px; background:#f2f2f2; border-radius:5px"> Reloadly has an open-source library used to format, parse, and validate the authenticity of an international phone number. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/google/libphonenumber">here on GitHub</a></blockquote>. <br> <br> <blockquote style="padding:15px; background:#f2f2f2; border-radius:5px"> Do note that this is a **PAID** service.
